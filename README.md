# React + Vite
This Counter App is a simple yet effective demonstration of state management using React and Redux. Built with a focus on usability, the application allows users to easily increment and decrement the counter value while providing a reset option to return the counter to zero. The app showcases the power of Redux in managing the application's state, making it easy to follow and maintain. With a responsive design, it ensures a seamless user experience across different devices. Whether you're looking to understand the fundamentals of React and Redux or just want a functional counter application, this project serves as an excellent starting point.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
